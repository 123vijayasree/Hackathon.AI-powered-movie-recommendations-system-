Project Title: AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System



📝 Project Description:



The AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System is a smart web-based application designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. It uses machine learning algorithms such as content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to generate accurate and personalized recommendations. The system enhances user experience by learning from their interactions and suggesting relevant content automatically.







✅Key Features:



•	User login and registration

•	Personalized movie recommendations

•	Content-based filtering using genres, plot summaries, and metadata

•	Collaborative filtering based on user ratings and preferences

•	Hybrid model for enhanced accuracy

•	Movie search functionality

•	Add to favorites/watch list

•	Clean and user-friendly interface



📥System Requirements:



💽Software Requirements:



	Python 3.7 or above

	Node.js and npm

	MongoDB or Firebase for database

	scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy (for ML models)

	React (for frontend) 

	Express.js (for backend API)

📋Hardware Requirements:

	4 GB RAM (minimum)

	2 GHz processor or better stable internet connection for API requests and deployment

📌Sample Output:

User Input: Rated 5 movies in the "Action" and "Sci-Fi" genres

📍Recommendation Output:



"Avengers: Endgame"

"Interstellar"

"The Matrix"

"Inception"

"Guardians of the Galaxy"

Explanation: Recommended based on genre preference, user similarity, and plot similarities

🔮Future Work:

	Integration of deep learning models (e.g., neural collaborative filtering)

	Use of NLP to analyze user reviews and improve recommendation quality

	Inclusion of multimodal data such as movie posters, trailers, and audio

	Context-aware recommendations (time of day, device used)

	Emotion-based suggestions using mood detection

	Chatbot and voice assistant support

	Cross-platform aggregation from Netflix, Prime Video, etc.

	Social sharing and group recommendation features.Implementing Explainable AI to provide transparency in suggestions
