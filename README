Node.js and npm

MongoDB or Firebase for database

scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy (for ML models)

React (for frontend)

Express.js (for backend API)


📋Hardware Requirements:

4 GB RAM (minimum)

2 GHz processor or better

Stable internet connection for API requests and deployment





📌Sample Output:

User Input: Rated 5 movies in the "Action" and "Sci-Fi" genres
